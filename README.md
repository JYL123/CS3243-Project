# CS3243-Project

## Possible features

1. `highestCol`: height of highest column
2. `lowestCol`: height of lowest column
3. `numberOfHoles`: number of empty cells with at least one full cell above
4. `numberOfIslands`: number of contiguous regions
5. `parityScore`: |number of black cells - number of white cells|
6. `sumOfEdgeHeights`?: sum of |height difference of adjacent columns|
7. `numBlockade` : number of filled cells above a hole




Implement parallelization (or other things) to accomodate scaling up to big data.
